# Working Group
Karpenter's community is open to everyone. All invites are managed through our [Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=N3FmZGVvZjVoZWJkZjZpMnJrMmplZzVqYmtAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ). Alternatively, you can use our [iCal Export](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/7qfdeof5hebdf6i2rk2jeg5jbk%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics) to add the events to Outlook or other email providers.
