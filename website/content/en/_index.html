    {{< blocks/feature title="Lower cluster costs" icon="fa-dollar-sign" feature_class="feature" >}}
      <p class="mt-3">Karpenter looks for opportunities to remove under-utilized nodes, replace expensive nodes with cheaper alternatives, or combine pods from multiple smaller nodes onto larger, more efficient ones. It is fully compatible with preemptible compute resource types which offer deep savings.</p>

    {{< blocks/feature title="Minimize operational overhead" icon="fa-wrench" feature_class="feature" >}}
      <p class="mt-3">Karpenter doesn't require configuring multiple, overlapping Kubernetes or cloud provider systems according to complex best practices. Works with many built-in Kubernetes scheduling constraints. Comes with a set of opinionated defaults in a single, declarative `Provisioner` resource which can easily be customized</p>
